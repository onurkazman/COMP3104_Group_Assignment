In this course students will learn the procedures, protocols and best practices a DevOps engineer brings to a workplace environment to increase overall company productivity. Examining case studies of developer operation implementations and with hands-on lab work using industry standard tooling, individuals will be better informed of the core responsibilities an engineer provides to help solve complex business problems. 

DevOps is an approach to software development, where the operations department collaborates with the development team during all phases of development. This includes product design, development, support, testing, and deployment.

A DevOps pipeline is based on Agile approaches. DevOps provides the same standards and quality checks as Agile development. Before Agile and DevOps, operations and developers worked in silos. Developers made the product, and the operations managed all the other processes. DevOps and Agile improve this approach by ensuring the successful delivery of software during every iteration. This approach improves both internal workflows and end-user experience.
